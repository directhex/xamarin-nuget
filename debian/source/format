By default, ?NuGet is configured with the main nuget.org package repository. 
An app's build system includes a "nuget restore" invocation (usually in the .csproj) which will parse
the list of packages in the packages.config file in the project source, download from any available 
repository (including dependencies), and unpack into the packages/ folder. 
Assembly references in the software's .csproj will reference the assemblies in packages/

Adapting NuGet for Debian
For Debian use, we need to support offline operation entirely. Our builders do not support internet access during builds, so cannot download .nupkg files.
